## Course Description
The Internet and mobile computing are changing our relationship to data. Data can be collected from more people, across longer periods of time, and a greater number of variables, at a lower cost and with less effort than ever before. This has brought opportunities and challenges to many domains, but the full impact on education is only beginning to be felt. Core Methods in Educational Data Mining provides an overview of the use of new data sources in education with the aim of developing studentsâ€™ ability to perform analyses and critically evaluate their application in this emerging field. It covers methods and technologies associated with Data Science, Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics, as well as discusses the opportunities for education that these methods present and the problems that they may create.
## Course Goals
This course is a survey of common applied education data mining methods. At the end of this course, 
learners will be able to:
1. Identify appropriate inquiry questions related to problems in learning, performance, evaluation, policies 
or other educational fields.
2. Answer common inquiry questions in education with appropriate data and methods in standard 
software packages.
3. Evaluate the strengths and limitations of common educational data mining methods.
4. Develop systematic inquiry plans of data analysis to answer the identified questions
5. Evaluate the implications of data science for educational research, policy, and practice.
